Mini Challenge 2-4
Summary - I used controllers and Services too create mini web api's. This assignment was quite difficult considering the due date, but I feel like I gained alot of knowledge on Api's because of it!
Peer Review: Bronel Lazar - everything functions properly and returns the data how it should. looks immaculate! His prompts made me chuckle as well.
